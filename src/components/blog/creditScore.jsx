                    <h6 className="my-3">
                    There are several misconceptions surrounding credit scores in Nigeria. Having an understanding of these misconceptions will help you avoid some pitfalls and avoid unnecessary mistakes.

                    </h6>
                    <h6>
                    <ol>
                      <li> No credit history is better than low credit history.
 </li>
                      <li> Constantly checking your credit score will negatively impact it. 
 </li>
                      <li> Closing a credit account will improve your credit score
 </li>
                      <li> Automatically paying off debt results in the perfect credit score
  </li>

                    If you look at how credit scores are set up, you will notice that much of the calculation focuses on existing or repaid credit. Getting more options or opportunities with a zero credit history may be challenging.

</h4>

                    <h6 className="my-3">
                    The good news is that building or improving your credit score is possible. Here are some ways you can go about it.

                    </h6>
                    <h6 className="my-3">
                    1. Pay your bills, loans, and credit card balances on time to demonstrate your creditworthiness to future lenders. Payments that are late or missed can have a substantial influence on your credit score.

                    </h6>
                    <h6 className="my-3">
                    2. Reduce your credit use. Pay off outstanding obligations to keep your credit utilization percentage below 30%. A lower credit utilization indicates competent credit management, which might help your credit score.

                    </h6>
                    <h6 className="my-3">
                    3. Limit new credit applications. Avoid applying for several credit cards or loans within a short period. Each application results in a hard inquiry on your credit report, which might reduce your credit score.

                    </h6>
                    <h6 className="my-3">
                    4. Review your credit report regularly to uncover any inaccuracies or irregularities affecting your credit score. Notify the credit bureau of any inaccuracies.

                    </h6>
                    <h6 className="my-3">
                    5. Diversify your credit accounts. Create a diverse credit portfolio that includes credit cards, loans, and mortgages. This demonstrates to lenders that you can manage various sorts of credit responsibly.

                    </h6>
                    <h6 className="my-3">
                    6. Keep a long credit history. Avoid cancelling old credit accounts because they add to the length of your credit history. A longer credit history offers lenders more information to analyze your trustworthiness.


                    </h6>
                    <h6 className="my-3">
                    7. Seek professional advice. If you're having trouble improving your credit, try consulting with a respected credit counselling service or financial advisor. They can offer tailored guidance and tactics to assist you in rebuilding your credit.

                    </h6>
                    <h6 className="my-3 mb-5">
