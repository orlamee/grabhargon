                      With the eligibility criteria, the lender can roughly

                    <h4 className="my-3"> 1. Build a Strong Credit History</h4>

                    <h6 className="my-3">
                      You can achieve this mainly by paying your bills and
                      outstanding debt on time. However, it also pays to
                      maintain a low credit utilization ratio and avoid defaults
                      or delinquencies. Regularly monitor your credit report and
                      address any errors promptly.

                    <h4 className="my-3">2. Increase Your Income</h4>

                    <h6 className="my-3">
                      A higher income will boost your ability to secure much
                      larger car or home loans. It will pay to consider ways to
                      increase your income. Example: freelance work, start a
                      side hustle, or invest in income-generating assets.

                    <h4 className="my-3">3. Reduce debt</h4>
                    <h6 className="my-3">
                      Pay off existing debts or consolidate them to lower your
                      debt-to-income ratio. Lenders always prefer borrowers with
                      lower debt levels. That's because it reduces the risk
                      associated with lending.

                    </h4>

                    <h6 className="mt-3 mb-5">
                      Assets are game changers when borrowing money. Lenders
                      appreciate this because it significantly reduces their
                      risk. If you have an asset, you can present it to boost
                      your eligibility for more credit.
