                      What are the common credit myths in Nigeria?
                    </h4>
                    <h6 className="my-3">
                      Credit myths are generally accepted but unfalsified
                      statements or beliefs held about credits. In Nigeria, one
                      of the reasons why credit is typically frowned upon is
                      because of these myths. Here are some of them
                    </h6>

                    <h4 className="my-4">1. I don't need credit</h4>

                    <h6 className="my-3">
                      Many people believe they don't need credit, especially if
                      they have sufficient money or do not intend to make large
                      expenditures.
                    </h6>
                    <h6 className="my-3">
                      Credit is much more than that. It is more than just
                      borrowing money. It is a tool that can assist you in
                      developing a solid financial profile, increasing your
                      purchasing power, and qualifying for lower loan rates.
                    </h6>
                    <h6 className="my-3">
                      Credit can also serve as a safety net in the event of an
                      emergency or unforeseen expense.
                    </h6>

                    <h4 className="my-4"> 2. Credit cards are dangerous</h4>
                    <h6 className="my-3">
                      Credit cards have an awful reputation, but they are not
                      inherently risky. In fact, they are usually safer than
                      debit cards.
                    </h6>
                    <h6 className="my-3">
                      True, misusing credit cards can lead to debt and financial
                      difficulties. On the other hand, credit cards can be a
                      beneficial financial instrument when used carefully. They
                      provide convenience, security, and a variety of
                      advantages, such as reward programs and fraud protection.
                    </h6>

                    <h4 className="my-4">3. I cannot check my credit score</h4>

                    <h6 className="my-3">
                      Checking your credit score is a "soft inquiry," and it
                      does not affect your credit score. Reviewing your credit
                      score frequently is critical to ensuring its correctness
                      and identifying any potential difficulties or errors.
                    </h6>

                    <h4 className="my-4">
                      4. Opening multiple credit accounts will boost my credit
                      score
                    </h4>

                    <h6 className="my-3">
                      Contrary to popular belief, opening multiple credit
                      accounts does not automatically boost your credit score.
                      It can have the opposite effect if not managed properly.
                    </h6>
                    <h6 className="my-3">
                      While having a diverse credit mix is important, using
                      credit responsibly and avoiding taking on more debt than
                      you can handle is crucial. Opening multiple credit
                      accounts without a solid repayment plan can lead to
                      financial strain and lower your credit score.
                    </h6>

                    <h4 className="my-4">
                      5. I can't get credit with a low income
                    </h4>

                    <h6 className="my-3">
                      Having a low income does not necessarily mean you can't
                      access credit. While income is one-factor lenders consider
                      when evaluating creditworthiness, it is not the only
                      criterion.
                    </h6>

                    <h6 className="my-3">
                      Lenders also consider factors such as credit history,
                      debt-to-income ratio, and employment stability. If you
                      have a low income, you can still build a strong credit
                      profile by making timely payments, keeping your debt
                      levels low, and demonstrating responsible financial
                      behaviour.

                    </h4>
                    <h6 className="my-3">
                      Credit myths have a tremendous impact not only on people
                      but also on the economy as a whole. People who are
                      ignorant about credit tend to make poor financial
                      decisions or pass up opportunities to better their
                      financial status.

                      insecurity. Furthermore, when credit myths hold people
                      back, economic progress slows, and the establishment of a
                      healthy financial ecosystem is hampered.
