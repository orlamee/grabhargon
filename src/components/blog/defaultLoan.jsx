                      Defaulting on loans can be more costly than you imagine,
                      but worse, it carries for way longer than you probably
                      think it should. The consequences can be far-reaching,
                      from poor credit scores to limited borrowing options.
                    </h6>
                    <h6 className="my-3">
                      When you default on a loan, it often starts off a domino
                      effect that can be quite challenging to recover from.
                      Understanding the consequences of defaulting on a loan
                      will help you make better decisions and proactively take
                      steps to avoid it.

                    <h6 className="my-3">
                      Let's see how loan repayment defaults can affect you.
                    </h6>

                    <h4 className="my-4">1. Reduces Credit Score</h4>
                    <h6 className="my-3">
                      Credit scores play a huge role when lenders assess your
                      eligibility for loans, and it is affected by several
                      factors. One of them is your loan repayment history.
                    </h6>
                    <h6 className="my-3">
                      When you default on loans, it reduces your credit score
                      and signals to future lenders that you are not
                      trustworthy, which impacts how much they want to deal with
                      you.
                    </h6>

                    <h4 className="my-4">
                      2. Difficulty Securing good loan terms
                    </h4>

                    <h6 className="my-3">
                      As mentioned earlier, defaulting on your credit score
                      impacts your credit score negatively. However, it goes
                      well beyond that.
                    </h6>
                    <h6 className="my-3">
                      When you have a poor or low credit score, lenders will
                      generally avoid doing business with you because you have
                      shown a history that puts their money at risk.
                    </h6>
                    <h6 className="my-3">
                      This makes it difficult for you to deal with legitimate
                      lenders and secure good payment terms, pushing you towards
                      alternative sources, often with exorbitant interests and
                      very unfavourable terms.
                    </h6>
                    <h6 className="my-3">
                      Overall it impacts your ability to pay back, putting you
                      in a cycle of loan defaults that can turn sour.
                    </h6>

                      3. Legal Implications and Harassment
                    </h4>
                    <h6 className="my-3">
                      Taking out a loan is a contractual process. Therefore,
                      defaulting on your loan repayment opens you up to
                      potential lawsuits and harassment from lenders.
                    </h6>
                    <h6 className="my-3">
                      Many credit platforms in Nigeria have been known to harass
                      loan defaulters by reaching out to their friends and loved
                      ones and sending embarrassing messages about them.
                    </h6>
                    <h6 className="my-3">
                      Imagine your boss or colleague telling you a company has
                      contacted them, claiming you are defaulting on loans.
                      Although this practice is frowned upon by the Nigerian
                      government, you should avoid it altogether.

                      Lawsuits can have untold effects on your finances and drag

                      4. Difficulty in Finding Employment and Housing
                    </h4>

                    <h6 className="my-3">
                      Defaulting on loans goes well beyond impacting your
                      financial life. It can also impact your personal life,
                      such as employment and housing.

                    <h6 className="my-3">
                      Some landlords in Nigeria want to know your credit history
                      to be sure you can pay rent when due. Getting that
                      landlord to trust you with the home becomes pretty
                      difficult when you default.

                    <h6 className="my-3">
                      Some job roles, especially in the finance industry, do
                      require your credit history, but when it is low, they may
                      find it difficult to give you a chance.

                      Defaulting on loans can have untold consequences. However,

                    <h6 className="my-3">
                      1. Seek professional help: You could get this from credit
                      counsellors or financial advisors. This will provide you
                      with guidance and support, translating into developing a
                      plan to address your debts.

                    <h6 className="my-3">
                      2. Debt consolidation options: Some options, such as debt
                      consolidation loans or debt management plans, can help you
                      combine multiple debts into a single payment, making it
                      more manageable to repay.

                    <h6 className="my-3">
                      3. Renegotiate Payment Terms: Want to know a little
                      secret? Lenders just want their money back. They are often
                      willing to renegotiate terms at a discounted rate to get
                      their money back. You can do this on hargon, use it to
                      your advantage, and kick-start negotiations for better
                      repayment terms.

                      Recovering from loan default and rebuilding your financial

                      time. All these can gradually improve your credit score.

                    <h6 className="my-3">
                      When you are done paying, consider getting a secured
                      credit card or a small personal loan to demonstrate
                      responsible credit behaviour. It will help show future
                      lenders that you are on the right track. Just ensure you
                      monitor your credit report regularly to ensure accuracy
